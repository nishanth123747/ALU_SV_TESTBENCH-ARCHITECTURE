# ALU_SV_VERIFICATION
This project presents a comprehensive approach to testing and verifying a parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a structured, object-oriented SystemVerilog verification environment. The main objective is to ensure the functional correctness and reliability of the ALU design through a scalable and systematic verification strategy.
